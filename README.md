# Conclusion:
San Jose seems to be the best place to open a sandwich cart considerng the high population, low existing food joints density and low cost per sandwich, followed by Fremont which even though does have high food joint density, has low enough per sandwich cost and high enough population, and Concord, which has the least density of food joints, cheap sandwiches and good enough population for possible customers.
